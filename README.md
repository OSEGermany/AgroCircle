# AgroCircle

These are the first steps to create an open documentation and design
for the [agrokruh](http://agrokruh.sk/) agricultural robot
invented by Ján Šlinský.

Lets work on the
[OSEG Wiki](https://wiki.opensourceecology.de/AgroCircle)
to establish a first description and
[Roadmap (on GitHub)](https://github.com/thoka/AgroCircle/wiki/Roadmap).

## Models

The OpenSCAD 3D model source files in this repo were
[auto-generated from FreeCAD models](
