 AgroCircle is a machine to effectivly produce sustainable vegetables,

 Small enough so it could come from renewables.
 Healthly vegetables - without concentrating the soil,
 without danger of air emissions from diesel maschines,
 in balance with the agro-eko system in organic quality & in normal prices.
 At the space of 2 hectares, you can grow about 25 tons of highly valuable vegetables with AgroCircle,
 while consuming only 4000 kWh of electrical energy annualy.
